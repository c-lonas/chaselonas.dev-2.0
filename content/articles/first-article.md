# An Introduction to Sample Coding Language

In this tutorial, we'll be exploring the Sample Coding Language, a popular language used for web development, data analysis, and more. We'll cover some of the basic concepts and provide code examples to help you get started.

## Variables and Data Types

Sample Coding Language has several basic data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings. Let's see how to declare variables with these data types:

```rust
let integerVar = 1
let floatVar = 1.0
let stringVar = "hello"


fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```


In this example, we declared three variables: integerVar, floatVar, and stringVar. Each variable holds a different data type.


## Control Structures

Control structures, like conditionals and loops, allow you to control the flow of your code. Here's an example of a simple if statement:

```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
```

This code checks if the value of x is greater than 5. If it is, it prints "x is greater than 5"; otherwise, it prints "x is not greater than 5".

## Functions
Functions are reusable pieces of code that can be called with arguments and return a value. Here's a simple function that adds two numbers:


```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

sum = add_numbers(3, 4)
print(sum)  # Output: 7
```
In this example, we defined a function called add_numbers that takes two arguments, a and b. The function adds the two numbers and returns the result.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered some basic concepts of the Sample Coding Language, including variables, data types, control structures, and functions. With this foundation, you can start exploring more advanced features and build your own projects.

Happy coding!
